# NotebookLM-style RAG App (MVP) Progress Log

This file tracks the implementation progress of the RAG application as specified in rules.txt.

## Project Overview
Building a Next.js application that:
1. Takes a documentation URL as input
2. Uses a Python script to fetch and convert content to Markdown
3. Implements RAG with Gemini for Q&A over the documentation

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Step 1: Set up Next.js project (Completed)
- Created a Next.js project with App Router
- Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
- Created basic project structure and configuration files
- Implemented root layout and homepage

### âœ… Step 2: URL Upload Page (Completed)
- Created URLInput component for submitting documentation URLs
- Implemented the /upload page with form submission
- Added validation and loading states
- Set up redirection to chat page after successful processing

### âœ… Step 3: /api/upload Route (Completed)
- Created API endpoint to accept URLs via POST
- Implemented Python script execution with spawn
- Set up markdown chunking with approximately 500 tokens per chunk
- Implemented embedding generation using Gemini Embeddings API
- Created in-memory vector store for chunked content

### âœ… Step 4: /api/chat Route (Completed)
- Implemented query processing endpoint
- Added RAG functionality to retrieve relevant context chunks
- Integrated with Gemini Pro for response generation

### âœ… Step 5: Chat Page (Completed)
- Implemented the chat interface with ChatBox component
- Created messaging system with user and assistant messages
- Added status checking to ensure documentation is loaded
- Implemented API call to generate responses using RAG

### âœ… Step 6: Modified Python Script (Completed)
- Updated the scrape_to_md.py script to accept URL parameters
- Added domain extraction to automatically filter by correct domain
- Implemented output file path parameter
- Enhanced error handling and reporting

## ðŸš€ Final Result
A functional NotebookLM-style RAG MVP that:
- Accepts a documentation URL from the user
- Processes that URL using a Python script to generate markdown content
- Chunks the markdown and creates embeddings using Gemini Embeddings API
- Stores the chunks and embeddings in an in-memory vector store
- Provides a chat interface where users can ask questions
- Retrieves relevant context chunks based on query similarity
- Generates contextually accurate responses using Gemini Pro

The application follows a typical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern:
1. **Retrieval**: Query embeddings are compared with document chunk embeddings to find relevant content
2. **Augmentation**: The relevant chunks are added to the prompt context
3. **Generation**: Gemini Pro generates a response based on the query and retrieved context

This implementation satisfies all the requirements and constraints specified in rules.txt.
